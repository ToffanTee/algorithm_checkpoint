# Algorithm Checkpoint

## Initialize three variables: vowelCount, wordCount, and sentCount to 0.

## Iterate over the string sentence character by character

## For each character:

- If the character is vowel, increment vowelCount.
- If the character is space, increment wordCount and reset sentCount to 0.
- Otherwise, increment sentCount.

## After iterating over the entire string, print the values of vowelCount, wordCount, and sentCount.
